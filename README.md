# Project Name : Job Analytics
# Introduction

The project aims to scrape job data from LinkedIn using the Python library BeautifulSoup and collate information in the given format. The scraped data will be transformed into three tables, namely jobs, company, and details, using Power Query. A search bar will be created using the Flask web framework where users can search for skills, and information such as the most common experience level, industry, and company class where the skill is required, and the number of jobs available will be displayed. Additionally, the FuzzyBuzzy library will be used to correct user input errors in the search bar.
